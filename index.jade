          p.
            This site is a public repository of free and open source software. It is located at
            Clarkson University in Potsdam, NY, US. This site strives to provide exposure to open
            source software and various open source operating systems. Currently, this site
            mirrors several Linux distributions, some third party repositories, and even the Linux
            Kernel. You can find out more information about everything we mirror by choosing
            the category that you are interested in.

              We host around 20 distributions including Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Linux Mint,
              and many more. Many are official mirrors and the majority are updated 4 times a
              day from upstream mirrors.

This is going to be a reboot of our current website for Clarkson's
[Mirror](http://mirror.clarkson.edu/). With this update, there are plans to create
a modern design and have the site be responsive as well.

## Setup
To compile the Sass and Jade files, type `npm install` (assuming npm is already installed)
and then either run the specific gulp tasks like `gulp jade` / `gulp sass`, or have them
recompile on modifications with `gulp watch`

## Tools used
- Sass
- Jade
- [normalize.scss](https://github.com/appleboy/normalize.scss)
- [Toast](https://daneden.github.io/Toast)
- [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

## Contribute
If you are interested in contributing, contact either [Benjamin Lannon](mailto:lannonbr@clarkson.edu)
